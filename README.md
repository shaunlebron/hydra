A mini-game for [Global Game Jam 2015](http://globalgamejam.org/).

The theme is "What do we do now?"

Hydra is a 2-player rock-paper-scissors-like game, in which players spawn from
the neck of a Hydra pursuing person in a maze.  A head spawns at each fork in
the maze.  First player to catch the person wins.
